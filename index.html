    <p>Malatang is a Sichuan-style Chinese street food and a form of "personal" hot pot where you choose your
      ingredients, which are then cooked to order in a flavorful, spicy, and numbing broth known as "mala".
      The name combines the Chinese words "ma" (numbing), "la" (spicy), "tang" (soup/broth) referring to the
      Sichuan peppercorns and chili peppers that give the broth its signature tingle and heat.</p>
